# senor_roboto
Goal: First robotics project
1. Platform slews to commanded azimuth
2. Platform slews to commanded elevation
3. Detect target
4. Understand where target is going (range, az, el)
5. Platform slews to follow target

# Todos:  
- [ ] DC Motor 
  - [ ] buy this (adafruit, digikey, or mouser)
  - [ ] breadboard to mess around controlling its angle
    - [ ] buy resistors
    - [ ] buy breadboard
    - [ ] buy power supply -- battery holder where I can add batteries to create my voltage
    - [ ] buy multimeter
    - [ ] Steal Conor's jumper wires
    - [ ] Steal Conor's alligator clips
    - [ ] Senor McFerren has LEDs as little indicators
- [ ] Sensor
  - [ ] buy
  - [ ] light up an indicator when I detect an object 
  - [ ] sensor understands target motion -- probably graph this on my computer
- [ ] Controller
  - [ ] buy
  - [ ] figure out arduino & fill out more tasks as necessary
- [ ] Controller + motor integration
  - [ ] input to arduino to control its angle via script
  - [ ] Integrate motor to actually determine yaw/pitch instead of just turning a knob
- [ ] Pan/tilt kit
  - [ ] Buy
  - [ ] Integrate with DC motor
- [ ] Controller + motor + sensor integration
  - [ ] 1D target following (PD control?)
  - [ ] 2D target following (PD control?)
  - [ ] More fun stuff?
- [ ] More fun stuff? like making a little Nerf launcher?
