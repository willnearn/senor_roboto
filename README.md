Goal: First robotics project
1. Platform slews to commanded azimuth
2. Platform slews to commanded elevation
3. Detect target
4. Understand where target is going (range, az, el)
5. Platform slews to follow target

  - [ ] figure out arduino & fill out more tasks as necessary
- [ ] Controller + motor integration
  - [ ] input to arduino to control its angle via script
  - [ ] Integrate motor to actually determine yaw/pitch instead of just turning a knob
- [ ] Pan/tilt kit
  - [ ] Buy
  - [ ] Integrate with DC motor
- [ ] Controller + motor + sensor integration
  - [ ] 1D target following (PD control?)
  - [ ] 2D target following (PD control?)
  - [ ] More fun stuff?
- [ ] More fun stuff? like making a little Nerf launcher?
